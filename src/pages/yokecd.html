  <h2>GitOps: Yoke & ArgoCD</h2>
  <p>
    The Yoke CLI is analogous to the Helm CLI. It is a client-side tool that communicates with your cluster and keeps
    track of packages deployed to it. However, for many, that is not how we deploy packages anymore. Where the words
    <em>Platform Engineering</em> are uttered, <em>GitOps</em> is sure to follow.
  </p>
  <p>
    To that end, we want to be able to write our Flights (programs that encapsulate a set of kubernetes packages as
    code) and have a continuous deployment tool, such as ArgoCD, manage our resources for us. Out of the box, ArgoCD
    supports Helm, Jsonnet, and Kustomize. To support more use cases, it accepts extensions via
    <a href="https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/config-management-plugins"
      >config management plugins</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    YokeCD is the official yoke config management plugin for ArgoCD. It allows you to write ArgoCD Applications but have
    their source evaluated by yoke's embedded wasm interpreter (wazero). The <strong>yokecd plugin</strong> supports a
    variety of setups:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Invoke a local wasm binary found in the application's source.</li>
    <li>Invoke a remote wasm binary downloaded from a http/https url.</li>
    <li>Compile an application's source on the fly and evaluate it using the Go Toolchain.</li>
    <li>Configure any invocation of the binary with flags and standard input defined in the plugin's definition.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Introducing YokeCD</h2>
  <p>
    To be compatible with ArgoCD, Yoke offers an ArgoCD CPM Sidecar Docker image hosted at
    <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/davidmdm/yokecd/general">DockerHub - davidmdm/yokecd</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Installing YokeCD Sidecar</h2>

  <h3>Fresh ArgoCD Installation</h3>
  <p>
    The yoke project maintains a Flight that wraps the
    <a href="https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/releases/tag/argo-cd-6.7.12"> ArgoCD Chart v6.17.2</a>. Any input
    passed to the flight via stdin is directly passed to the ArgoCD Chart. Additionally the Flight installs the sidecar
    on the argocd-repo-server making the yokecd plugin available to argocd applications.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-bash">yoke takeoff --namespace argocd yokecd https://github.com/davidmdm/yoke/releases/download/yokecd-installer%2Fv0.0.2/yokecd-installer.wasm.gz</code></pre>

  <h3>Patch an Existing ArgoCD Installation</h3>
  <p>
    If you already have an existing ArgoCD installating you must patch the argocd-repo-server with the yokecd sidecar
    image. To do so create the following manifest substituting any names to match your deployment:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: YOUR-ARGOCD-REPO-SERVER-NAME    # typically "argocd-repo-server", possibly with a prefix if installed via helm.
  namespace: YOUR-ARGOCD-NAMESPACE-NAME # typically "argocd"
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: yokecd
          image: davidmdm/yokecd:latest
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent # use the imagePullPolicy that best fits your needs.
          command:
            - /var/run/argocd/argocd-cmp-server
          securityContext: # required by argocd cmp spec. Must be user 999.
            runAsNonRoot: true
            runAsUser: 999
          volumeMounts:
            - name: var-files
              mountPath: /var/run/argocd
            - name: plugins
              mountPath: /home/argocd/cmp-server/plugins
            - name: cmp-tmp
              mountPath: /tmp
      volumes:
        - name: cmp-tmp
          emptyDir: {}</code></pre>

  <p>
    Once your file is created, let's call it `patch.yaml`, we can now proceed to patch the existing argocd deployment.
    We will assumed in the following command that the argocd repo server deployment has name
    <strong>argocd-repo-server</strong> as per the standard installation. If this is not the case for your installation
    please substitute the name accordingly. We will also assume that ArgoCD is deployed in a namespace named
    <strong>argocd</strong>, if this is not the case please substitute accordingly once more.
  </p>

  <h2>Creating YokeCD Applications</h2>
  <p>YokeCD applications are normal ArgoCD Applications that use the yokecd plugin.</p>
  <pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    plugin:
      name: yokecd
# ... and all other required fields</code></pre>

  <h3>Parameters</h3>
  <p>
    In order to use and configure the plugin, we must pass parameters to it. The following parameters are supported:
  </p>

  <div class="table">
    <div><strong>Parameter</strong></div>
    <div><strong>Type</strong></div>
    <div><strong>Description</strong></div>

    <div>wasm</div>
    <div>string</div>
    <div>
      The url to download or the relative location in the source repository to the Flight's wasm asset. Cannot be used
      when parameter <strong>build</strong> is enabled.
    </div>

    <div>build</div>
    <div>string</div>
    <div>
      A boolean string signalling that the wasm should be compiled on the fly by yokecd using the Go Toolchain in the
      context of the Application's source. Cannot be used with parameter <strong>wasm</strong>
    </div>

    <div>input</div>
    <div>string</div>
    <div>The input that will be passed as stdin to the wasm executable upon execution</div>

    <div>args</div>
    <div>[]string</div>
    <div>The args that will be passed to the Flight Executable upon execution</div>
  </div>

  <p><strong>One of build or wasm must be specified.</strong></p>

  <h2>YokeCD Service Catalog</h2>
  <p>
    When using ArgoCD, it is common to use the app of apps pattern, and have a root application watch a repository for
    more applications. Any repository that contains Flight programs can deploy them with ArgoCD via the
    <strong>yokecd plugin</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following is an example structure of a service catalog with two releases: alpha and beta. Both releases are
    described as Go programs and contain an ArgoCD Application manifest that would use the
    <strong>yokecd plugin with build parameter</strong>.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-bash">services
├── alpha
│   ├── app.yaml
│   └── main.go
├── beta
│   ├── app.yaml
│   └── main.go
├── go.mod
└── go.sum
</code></pre>
  <p>
    Other setups are possible, and any service repository can be mixed and matched with regular ArgoCD Applications.
