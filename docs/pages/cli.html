          Takeoff
        </h2>
        <p>
          This command applies creates releases or new revisions of releases to your cluster. Release resources can be created
          from wasm executables or passed directly to takeoff via stdin.
        </p>
        <pre class="code"><code><span class="yellow">yoke takeoff</span>

<span class="cyan">Usage:</span>
  yoke takeoff [flags] &lt;release-name&gt; &lt;flight-path&gt;

<span class="cyan">Aliases:</span>
  apply, up

<span class="cyan">Examples:</span>
  # deploy a local flight
  yoke takeoff my-release ./main.wasm

  # gzipped wasm files are supported
  yoke takeoff my-release ./main.wasm.gz

  # deploy a remote flight
  yoke takeoff my-release https://github.com/my_org/infra/releases/v1.2.3-release.wasm

  # deploy passing arguments to the flight
  yoke takeoff my-release ./main.wasm -- -env prod

  # deploy passing data over stdin to the flight
  yoke takeoff my-release ./main.wasm &lt; input.file

  # omit the wasm asset and stdin is interpreted as the desired output of your flight
  yoke takeoff my-release &lt; resources.json

  # deploy resources from a unix pipe
  generate-resources.sh | yoke takeoff my-releae

  # view the diff between would be applied release resources and the current state of the release.
  yoke takeoff -diff-only my-release main.wasm

<span class="cyan">Flags:</span>
  -force-conflicts
        force apply changes on field manager conflicts
  -kubeconfig string
        path to kube config
  -namespace string
        preferred namespace for resources if they do not define one (default "default")
  -out string
        if present outputs flight resources to directory specified, if out is - outputs to standard out
  -skip-dry-run
        disables running dry run to resources before applying them
  -test-run
        test-run executes the underlying wasm and outputs it to stdout but does not apply any resources to the cluster

        <h2>
          Descent
        </h2>
        <p>
          This command allows you to restore previous revision states. Yoke keeps track of each release's revision history and
          allows you to rollback to previous versions. This command will cleanup resources from a previous state just as
          takeoff does when creating new releases.

          This command removes a release entirely. It will cleanup all resources in the releases and remove the release. You
          will not be able to use descent/rollback afterwards. This command is equivalent to a hard delete.

          This command allows you to inspect your various releases, their revision history, and their diffs. It also allows

        <h2>
          Turbulence
        </h2>
        <p>
          This command is used to view any drift between your desired release state and the state of the cluster. This drift
          often happens when developers run experiments on state in the cluster via manual edits and forget to clean them up.
          It works by looking for conflicts between desired and actual state. This limitation means that added state is not
          removed when turbulence is fixed.
        </p>
        <p>
          An option to do a hard replace will be provided in a future release.

        fix the drift. If present conflict-only will be true.
