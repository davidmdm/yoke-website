  <h2>GitOps: Yoke & ArgoCD</h2>
  <p>
    The Yoke CLI is analogous to Helm's. It is a client-side tool that communicates with your cluster and keeps track of
    packages deployed to it. However, for many, that is not how we deploy packages anymore, Helm or not. Where the words
    <em>Platform Engineering</em> are uttered, <em>GitOps</em> is sure to follow.
  </p>
  <p>
    To that end, we want to be able to declare our Flights as static resources that a controller such as ArgoCD will
    pick up and then manage our resources for us. Out of the box, ArgoCD supports Helm, Jsonnet, and Kustomize. To
    support more use cases, it accepts extensions to K8s manifest generation via
    <a href="https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/config-management-plugins"
      >config management plugins</a
    >.
