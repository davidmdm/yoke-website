  <h2>Gitops: Yoke & ArgoCD</h2>
  <p>
    The yoke CLI is analagous to helm's. It is is a client-side tool that communicates with your cluster and keeps track
    of packages deployed to it. However, for many that is not how we deploy packages anymore, helm or not. Where the
    words <em>Platform Engineering</em> are uttered <em>GitOps</em> is sure to follow.
  </p>
  <p>
    To that end, we want to be able to declare our Flights as static resources that a controller such as ArgoCD will
    pick up, and then manage our resources for us. Out of the box ArgoCD supports helm, jsonnette, and kustomize. It
    also allows you to extend its behavior using

    >.
