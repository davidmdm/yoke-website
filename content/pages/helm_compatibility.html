<h1>Helm Compatibility</h1>

<section class="container">
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Although Yoke has the potential to change how we write Kubernetes Packages, as of today and for the past almost 10
    years, kubernetes package management has been dominated by <a href="https://helm.sh">Helm</a>. Yoke has no chance of
    succeeding if it cannot build off of Helm and provide a migration path forward.
  </p>
  <p class="pre-list">
    At its core, a Yoke Flight is a piece of software that generates Kubernetes resources. In that way, even a Helm
    Chart is a subset of Flights. From that vantage point, our Flight needs to accomplish two things to be compatible
    with Helm:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Embed a Chart.</li>
    <li>Render the Chart with some values.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>At the time of this writing, Yoke provides Go packages to accomplish the above items simply and easily.</p>
