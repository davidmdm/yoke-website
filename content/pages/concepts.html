  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Flights in Yoke are analogous to Charts in Helm. A Chart is a collection of templates packaged as one referencable
    entity. Similarly, in Yoke, Flights refer to both the code generating Kubernetes resources and the packaged
    WebAssembly (wasm) asset representing the executable.
  </p>
  <p>
    At its heart, a Flight is a piece of software that generates Kubernetes resources. In that way, even a Helm Chart is
    a subset of Flights (Go see <a href="/content/pages/helm_compatibility.html">Helm Compatibility</a> for more
    information). This allows us to view Flights at two levels: High and Low Altitude Flights (high-Level vs low-level).
  </p>
  <h3>High Altitude Flights</h3>
  <p>
    High-Level Flights are the programs/runtimes/compiled wasm executables that generate the Kubernetes Package Instance
    for deployment.
  </p>
  <h3>Low Altitude Flights</h3>
  <p>
    Low-Level Flights are the building blocks of the software. These are most likely represented as functions that take
    inputs and return k8s resources. Unlike Helm Charts, they are not managed by a centralized repository, as they can
    be shared via their language's ecosystems: npm, go modules, cargo, gems, and so on.
